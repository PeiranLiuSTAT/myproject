<!-- This is the format for text comments that will be ignored during renderings. Do not put R code in these comments because it will not be ignored. -->

```{r, setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  echo = FALSE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "../figures/"
)

 # Or use devtools::load_all('.', quiet = T) if your code is in script files, rather than as functions in the `/R` diretory
```

# Introduction

Here is a citation [@Marwick2017]

# Background

## Background Subsection
```{r demo, eval = TRUE, fig.cap="My Plot"}
x <- 1 + 1
plot(1:10, 1:10, pch = 16)
plot(rnorm(40), rnorm(40), pch = 16)
```

The result of the calculation is `r x`.

Control+Option+(Alt) + i
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/demo-1.png")
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris))
```

# Methods

# Results

```{r get-data, eval = TRUE}
# Note the path that we need to use to access our data files when rendering this document
# my_data <- read.csv(here::here('analysis', 'data', 'raw_data', 'my_csv_file.csv'))
x <- x + 1
```

Test `r x` has changed or not.
